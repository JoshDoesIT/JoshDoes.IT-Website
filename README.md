### How It Works

- **`app/blog/`** - Next.js routing and React components that render blog pages
  - `[slug]/page.tsx` - Creates dynamic routes like `/blog/ai-embeddings-control-mapping`
  - `page.tsx` - Renders the blog listing page at `/blog`
  - `posts.ts` - Server-side code that reads markdown files from `content/blog/`

- **`content/blog/`** - Where blog posts are stored
  - Each `.md` file becomes a blog post
  - Frontmatter (title, date, tags, etc.) is parsed from the file header

- **`public/blog_post_images/`** - Images used in blog posts
  - Images are organized in folders by blog post name
  - Referenced in markdown like: `![alt text](/blog_post_images/post-name/image.png)`

## Blog Posts

Blog posts are written in Markdown and stored in `content/blog/`. Each post includes frontmatter with metadata:

```markdown
---
title: 'Post Title'
date: '2025-11-15'
description: 'Post description'
tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2']
icon: 'fa-file-code'
---

# Post Content

Markdown content here...
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed to Vercel and automatically deploys on every push to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Code is pushed to the main branch on GitHub
2. Vercel automatically builds and deploys the site
3. The site is live at [joshdoes.it](https://joshdoes.it)

## Terminal Theme

The site uses a custom terminal color scheme:

- Background: `#0a0a0a` (terminal-bg)
- Surface: `#1a1a1a` (terminal-surface)
- Border: `#333333` (terminal-border)
- Green: `#00ff41` (terminal-green)
- Gray: `#a0a0a0` (terminal-gray)

Colors can be customized in `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Security

The site implements several security measures:

- XSS protection in markdown rendering with URL sanitization
- Path traversal prevention for blog post slugs
- Input validation and length limits on search functionality
- HTML entity escaping throughout the application
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configured
