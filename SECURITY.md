# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use [GitHub's private security advisory reporting](https://github.com/JoshDoesIT/JoshDoes.IT-Website/security/advisories/new) to submit your report. This keeps the disclosure private until a fix is available.

When submitting an advisory, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant screenshots or proof-of-concept code
- Your recommended fix, if applicable

I will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and provide an estimated timeline for a fix. Once the issue is resolved, I will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
